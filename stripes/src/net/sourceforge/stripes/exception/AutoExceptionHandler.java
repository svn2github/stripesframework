/**
 * <p>A marker interface for delegate exception handlers to be used with the
 * {@link DelegatingExceptionHandler}.  Note that the DelegatingExceptionHandler must be
 * configured as the {@link ExceptionHandler} for the application in order for AutoExceptionHandlers
 * to be discovered and used.</p>
 *
 * <p>AutoExceptionHandlers can define one or more methods to handle different kinds of exceptions.
 * Each method must have the following signature:</p>
 *
 *<pre>public Resolution handle(Type exception, HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res);</pre>
 *
 * <p>where <tt>Type</tt> can be any subclass of {@link java.lang.Throwable}.  The name of the
 * method does not matter and the return type is only loosely enforced. If the method
 * returns an object and it is a {@link net.sourceforge.stripes.action.Resolution} then it
 * will be executed, otherwise it will be ignored.</p>
