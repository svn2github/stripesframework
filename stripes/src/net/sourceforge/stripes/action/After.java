/**
 * <p>Specifies that the annotated method should be run <i>after</i> the specified
 * {@link LifecycleStage}(s). More than one LifecycleStage can be specified, in which case the
 * method will be run after each stage completes. If no LifecycleStage is specified then the
 * default is to execute the method after {@link LifecycleStage#EventHandling}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The method may have any name, but must by public and take no arguments. Methods may return
 * values; if the value is a {@link net.sourceforge.stripes.action.Resolution} it will be used
 * immediately to terminate the request.  Any other values returned will be ignored.</p>
 *
 * <p>Examples:</p>
 *<pre>
 * // Runs only after the event handling method has been run
 * {@literal @After}
 * public void doStuff() {
 * 	...
 * }
 *
 * // Runs after binding and validation have completed
 * {@literal @After(LifecycleStage.BindingAndValidation)}
 * public void doPostValidationStuff() {
 * 	...
 * }
 *
 * // Runs twice, once after each validation-related stage
 * {@literal @}After({LifecycleStage.BindingAndValidation, LifecycleStage.CustomValidation})
 * public void doMorePostValidationStuff() {
 * 	...
 * }
