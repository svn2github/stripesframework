/**
 * <p>This tag supports the use of Stripes ActionBean classes as view helpers.
 * It allows for the use of actions as the controller and then their reuse
 * on the page, creating it if it does not exist. A typical usage pattern would
 * be for a page that contains two types of information, the interaction with each being
 * handled by separate ActionBean implementation. Some page events route to the first
 * action and others to the second, but the page still requires data from both in
 * order to render. This tag would define both ActionBeans in the page scope, creating
 * the one that wasn't executing the event.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class will bind parameters to a created ActionBean just as the execution of
 * an event on an ActionBean would. It does not rebind values to ActionBeans that
 * were previously created for execution of the action. Validation is not done
 * during this binding, except the type conversion required for binding, and no
 * validaiton errors are produced.</p>
 *
 * <p>The binding of the ActionBean to the page scope happens whether the ActionBean
 * is created or not, making for a consistent variable to always use when referncing
 * the ActionBean.</p>
