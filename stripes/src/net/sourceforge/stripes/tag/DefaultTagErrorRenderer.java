/**
 * <p>This default implementation of the TagErrorRenderer interface sets the html class
 * attribute to 'error'.  More specifically, if the tag had no previous CSS class, it
 * will have its class attribute set to error. If it previously had a CSS class attribute,
 * e.g. class="foo", then it's class attribute will be re-written as class="foo error",
 * which instructs the browser to apply both styles, with error taking precedence. The
 * use of a single class name allows applications to define a single style for all input
 * fields, and then override it for specific fields as they choose.</p>
 *
 * <p>An example of the css definition to set backgrounds to yellow by default, but
 * to red for checkboxes and radio buttons follows:</p>

 * {@code
 *   input.error { background-color: yellow; }
 *   input[type="checkbox"].error, input[type="radio"].error {background-color: red; }
 * }
