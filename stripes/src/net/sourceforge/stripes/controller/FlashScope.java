/**
 * <p>A FlashScope is an object that can be used to store objects and make them available as
 * request parameters during this request cycle and the next one.  It is extremely useful
 * when implementing the redirect-after-post pattern in which an ActionBean receives a POST,
 * does some processing and then redirects to a JSP to display the outcome. FlashScopes make
 * <i>temporary</i> use of session to store themselves briefly between two requests.</p>
 *
 * <p>In general, use of the FlashScope should be intermediated by the
 * {@link net.sourceforge.stripes.action.ActionBeanContext}, making it transparent to the
 * rest of the application.  Any object that is put into a FlashScope will be immediately
 * exposed in the current request as a request attribute, and under certain conditions will
 * also be exposed in the subsequent request as a request attribute.</p>
 *
 * <p>To make values available to the subsequent request a parameter must be included in
 * the redirect URL that identifies the flash scope to use (this avoids collisions where two
 * concurrent requests in the same session might otherwise cause problems for one another).
 * The Stripes {@link net.sourceforge.stripes.action.RedirectResolution} will automatically
 * insert this parameter into the URL when a flash scope is present.  Should you wish to issue
 * redirects using a different mechanism you will need to add the parameter using code
 * similar to the following:</p>
 *
 *<pre>
 *FlashScope flash = FlashScope.getCurrent(request, false);
 *if (flash != null) {
 *    url.addParameter(StripesConstants.URL_KEY_FLASH_SCOPE_ID, flash.key());
 *}
 *</pre>
 *
 * <p>The lifecycle of a FlashScope is managed is conjunction with the {@link StripesFilter}.
 * FlashScopes are manufactured using lazy instantiation when
 * {@code FlashScope.getCurrent(request, true)} is called.  When a request is completed, the
 * StripesFilter notifies the current FlashScope that the request is over, which causes it
 * to record the time when the request terminated.  On the subsequent request, if the flash
 * scope is referenced by a URL parameter, then it is removed from session and it's contents
 * are pushed into request attributes for the current request.</p>
 *
 * <p>To ensure that orphaned FlashScopes do not consume increasing amounts of HttpSession memory,
 * the StripesFilter, after each request, checks to see if any FlashScopes have been present
 * longer than a pre-determined length of time.  Since the timer starts when a request completes,
 * and FlashScopes are only meant to live from the end of one request to the beginning of a
 * subsequent request this value is set quite low.</p>
