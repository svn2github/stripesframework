/**
 * <p>An ActionResolver that uses the names of classes and methods to generate sensible default
 * URL bindings and event names respectively. Extends the default
 * {@link AnnotatedClassActionResolver}, and is fully backward compatible.  Any classes and
 * methods that are annotated with {@link net.sourceforge.stripes.action.UrlBinding} and
 * {@link net.sourceforge.stripes.action.HandlesEvent} will retain the bindings specified in
 * those annotations.  In the case when an annotation is absent then a default binding is
 * generated.</p>
 *
 * <p>The generation of ActionBean URL bindings is done by taking the class name and removing
 * any extraneous packages at the front of the name, removing the strings "Action" and "Bean"
 * from the end of the name, substituting slashes for periods and appending a suffix (.action by
 * default).  The set of packages that are trimmed is specified by the
 * {@code getBasePackages()} method.  By default this method returns the set
 * [web, www, stripes, action].  These packages (and their parents) are removed from the
 * class name. E.g. {@code com.myco.web.foo.BarActionBean} would become {@code foo.BarActionBean}.
 * Continuing on, we would trim this further to {@code foo.Bar} and then translate it to
 * {@code /foo/Bar}.  Lastly the suffix returned by {@code getBindingSuffix()} is appended
 * giving the binding {@code /foo/Bar.action}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The translation of class names into URL bindings is designed to be easy to override and
 * customize.  To that end you can easiliy change how this translation is done by overriding
 * {@code getBasePackages()} and/or {@code getBindingSuffix()}, or completely customize the
 * behaviour by overriding {@code getUrlBinding(String)}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Mapping of method names to event names is simpler.  Again the parent class is delegated to
 * in case the method is annotated. If it is not, and the method is a concrete public method that
 * returns a Resolution (or subclass thereof) it is mapped to an event of the same name as the
 * method.  So an un-annotated method "{@code public Resolution view()}" is mapped to an event
 * called "view".  It should be noted that there is no special method name that signifies the
 * default handler.  If there is more than one handler and you require a default handler you
 * must still mark the default method with {@code @DefaultHandler}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Another useful feature of the NameBasedActionResolver is that when a request arrives for a
 * URL that is not bound to an ActionBean the resolver will attempt to map the request to a view
 * and return a 'dummy' ActionBean that will take the user to the view.  The exact behaviour is
 * modifiable by overriding one or more of
 * {@link #handleActionBeanNotFound(ActionBeanContext, String)} or {@link #findView(String)}. The
 * default behaviour is to map the URL being requested to three potential JSP names/paths, check
 * for the existence of a JSP at those locations and if one exists then to return an ActionBean
 * that will render the view.  For example if a user requsted '/account/ViewAccount.action' but
 * an ActionBean does not yet exist bound to that URL, the resolver will check for JSPs in the
 * following order:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>/account/ViewAccount.jsp</li>
 *   <li>/account/viewAccount.jsp</li>
 *   <li>/account/view_account.jsp</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The value of this approach comes from the fact that by default all pages can appear to have
 * a pre-action whether they actually have one or not.  In the above can you might chose to link
 * to {@code /account/ViewAccount.action} even though you know that no action exists and you want
 * to navigate directly to a page. This way, if you later decide you do need a pre-action for any
 * reason you can simply code the ActionBean and be done.  No URLs or links need to be modified
 * and all requests to {@code /account/ViewAccount.action} will flow through the ActionBean.</p>
