/**
 * <p>Cryptographic utility that can encrypt and decrypt Strings using a key stored in
 * HttpSession.  Strings are encrypted by default using a 168bit DEDede (triple DES) key
 * and then Base 64 encoded in a way that is compatible with being inserte into web pages.</p>
 *
 * <p>A single encryption key is used to encrypt values for all sessions in the web application.
 * The key can come from multiple sources. Without any configuration the key will be generated
 * using a SecureRandom the first time it is needed. <b>Note: this will result in encrypted
 * values that are not decryptable across application restarts or across nodes in a cluster.</b>
 * Alternatively specific key material can be specified using the configuration parameter
 * <code>Stripes.EncryptionKey</code> in web.xml.  This key is text that is used to generate
 * a secret key, and ideally should be quite long (at least 20 characters).  If a key is
 * configured this way the same key will be used across all nodes in a cluster and across
 * restarts.</p>
 *
 * <p>Finally a key can be specified by calling {@link #setSecretKey(javax.crypto.SecretKey)} and
 * providing your own {@link SecretKey} instance. This method allows the specification of any
 * key from any source.  In addition they provided key can be for any algorithm supported by
 * the JVM in which it is constructed.  CryptoUtil will then use the algorithm returned by
 * {@link javax.crypto.SecretKey#getAlgorithm()}.  If using this method, the key should be set
 * before any requests are made, e.g. in a {@link javax.servlet.ServletContextListener}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Two additional measures are taken to improve security. Firstly a nonce value is prepended
 * to the input during encryption.  This is a value generated each time using a SecureRandom.
 * Doing this ensures that the same value is not encrypted the same way each time and leads to
 * increased unpredictabibilty of the encrypted values.  Secondly a "magic number" is also
 * prepended to the input (after the nonce).  The magic number is verified at decryption time
 * to ensure that the value passed in was encrypted using the same key as was used for decryption.</p>
